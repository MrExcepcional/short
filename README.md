## Project to demonstrate my acquired skills

### Constrains of this demostration project:
- I will only test with Firefoxwebdriver for simplification.

### Install pre-requirements:
* Download and extract geckodriver on your (windows) python scripts folder or the same folder as your code. For mac or linux usr/local/bin is a good place (you'll use sudo)
* Setup a virtualenv with python3.6

### Install requirements:

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
