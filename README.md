## Project to demonstrate my acquired skills
### Install pre-requisites:
* Download and extract geckodriver on your (windows) python scripts folder or the same folder as your code. For mac or linux usr/local/bin is a good place (you'll use sudo)
* Setup a virtualenv with python3.6 and Selenium in it
